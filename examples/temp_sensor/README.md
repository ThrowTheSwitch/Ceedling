# Ceedling Temp-Sensor Example

*Welcome to the Temp-Sensor Example!* This is a medium-sized example of how Ceedling 
might work in your system. You can use it to verify you have all the tools installed.
You can use it as a starting point for your own code. You can build upon it for your
own creations, though honestly it's a bit of a mess. While it has some good ideas in
it, really it serves as a testing ground for some of Ceedling's features, and a place
for you to explore how Ceedling works.

You'll find all the source files in the `src` folder. You'll find all the tests in 
(you guessed it) the `test` folder (and its sub-folders). There are also some files
in the `test/support` folder, which demonstrate how you can create your own assertions.

This project assumes you have `gcov` and `gcovr` installed for collecting coverage 
information. If that's not true, you can just remove the `gcov` plugin from the 
`plugins` list. Everything else will work fine. 

Have fun poking around!
