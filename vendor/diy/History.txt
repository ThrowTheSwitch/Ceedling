== 1.1.2 / 2009-11-30
  * Converted to Jeweler for gem packaging
  * diy/factory.rb was somehow missing from the 1.1.1 gem on gemcutter. This has been fixed as part of the Jeweler changeover.
  * Rebuilt homepage http://atomicobject.github.com/diy

== 1.1.1 / 2008-05-21
  * Fixed bug that did not allow a method to be properly injected into an object

== 1.1 / 2008-05-20
  * Added 'method' directive for building a bounded method from an object defined in diy

== 1.0.3 / 2007-12-11

* The 1.0.1 release had a load-path search in it that resulted in requiring files with full path names (rooted in loadpath entries).  This is unintuitive, and will almost always result in a double "require" if the application code ever requires a library.  The "require" for library loading now relies implicitly on the load path (just like normal human-coded requires.)

== 1.0.1 / 2007-12-02

* Added 'using_namespace' directive for assuming a module for a group of object defs
* Added 'use_class_directly' option for configuring an ObjectDef.  Instead of instantiating an instance
  of the specified class, the class itself is referenced.  (Good for injecting ActiveRecord classes into
  other components in the guise of factories.
* Added DIY::Context.auto_require boolean setting. When false, the library of a
  class is not autoloaded ahead of object construction. Is true by default.
* 'auto_require' can, if neccessary, be set in the YAML config for an individual object.

== 1.0.0 / 2007-11-19

* Released!
