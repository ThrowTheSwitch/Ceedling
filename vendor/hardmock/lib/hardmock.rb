  # * +force+ -- if +false+, and a VerifyError or ExpectationError has already occurred, this method will not raise.  This is to help you suppress repeated errors when if you're calling #verify_mocks in the teardown method of your test suite.  BE WARNED - only use this if you're sure you aren't obscuring useful information.  Eg, if your code handles exceptions internally, and an ExpectationError gets gobbled up by your +rescue+ block, the cause of failure for your test may be hidden from you.  For this reason, #verify_mocks defaults to force=true as of Hardmock 1.0.1
