== Constructor

* http://atomicobject.github.com/constructor

== DESCRIPTION:
  
Declarative means to define object properties by passing a hash 
to the constructor, which will set the corresponding ivars.

== SYNOPSIS:

  require 'constructor'

  class Horse
    constructor :name, :breed, :weight
  end
  Horse.new :name => 'Ed', :breed => 'Mustang', :weight => 342

By default the ivars do not get accessors defined.
But you can get them auto-made if you want:

  class Horse
    constructor :name, :breed, :weight, :accessors => true
  end
  ...
  puts my_horse.weight
 
Arguments specified are required by default.  You can disable 
strict argument checking with :strict option.  This means that 
the constructor will not raise an error if you pass more or 
fewer arguments than declared.

  class Donkey
    constructor :age, :odor, :strict => false
  end

... this allows you to pass either an age or odor key (or neither)
to the Donkey constructor.
