  ## Includes Extraction Overview
  ## ============================
  ##
  ## BACKGROUND
  ## #include extraction is hard to do. In simple cases a regex approach suffices. Not all the uncommon nested 
  ## header files, clever macros, and conditional preprocessing statements introduce high complexity.
  ##
  ## Unfortunately, there's no easily available C parsing tool that provides a simple means to extract the 
  ## #include statements directly embedded in a given file. Even the gcc preprocessor itself only comes close 
  ## to providing this information.
  ##
  ## APPROACH
  ## --------
  ## (Full details including fallback options are in the extensive code comments among the methods below.)
  ## 
  ## Sadly, we can't preprocess a file with full search paths and defines and ask for the #include statements
  ## embedded in a file. We get far more #includes than we want with no was to discern which are at the depth
  ## of the file being processed.
  ##
  ## Instead, we try our best to use some educated guessing to get as close as possible to the desired list.
  ##
  ##   I. Try to extract shallow defines with no crawling out into other header files. This gives us a 
  ##      reference point on possible directly included files. The results may be incomplete, though. They 
  ##      also may mistakenly list #includes that should not be in the list--because of #ifndef defaults or
  ##      because of system headers or #include <...> statements and differences among gcc implementations.
  ##
  ##  II. Extract a full list of #includes by spidering out into nested headers and processing all macros, etc.
  ##
  ## III. Find #includes common to (I) and (II). THe results of (I) should limit the potentially lengthy
  ##      results of (II). The complete and accurate list of (II) should cut out any mistaken entries in (I).
  ##
  ##  IV. I–III are not foolproof. This approach should come quite close to an accurate list of shallow
  ##      includes. Edge cases and gaps will cause trouble. Other Ceedling features should provide the tools
  ##      to intervene.

    ## Preprocessor Make Rule Handling
    ## ===============================
    ##
    ## Creation:
    ##  - This output is created with the -MM -MG -MP command line options.
    ##  - No search paths are used towards extracting only the #include statements of the file.
    ##    The intent is to minimize the list of .h -> .c module matches to, in turn, minimize
    ##    unnecessary compilation when extracting includes from a test file.
    ##  - Note: This approach can have gaps with complex macros / conditional statements.
    ##          Gaps can be minimized with proper defines in the project file.
    ##          However, needed / complex macros located in other header files can still gum 
    ##          up the works.
    ##
    ## Format:
    ##  - First line is .o file followed by colon and dependencies (on one or more lines).
    ##  - "Phony" make rules follow that conveniently list each #include, one per line.
    ##
    ## Notes:
    ##  - Many errors can occur but may not necessarily prevent usable results.
    ##  - A file with no includes will create the first line with self-referential .h file path.
    ##  - Make rule formation assumes any files not found in a search path will be generated.
    ##    - Since we're not using search paths, the preprocessor largely assumes all #include 
    ##      files are generated (and include no paths).
    ##    - The exception is #include files that exist in the same directory as the file
    ##      being processed.
    ##
    ## Approach:
    ##  1. Disable exceptions for tool execution as errors are likely.
    ##    - We may still have usable output.
    ##    - We do not want to stop execution on fatal error; instead use a fallback method.
    ##  2. The only true error is no make rule present--check for this first.
    ##    - A make rule may be present but not depedencies if the file has no #includes.
    ##  3. Extract includes from "phony" make rules that follow opening rule line.
    ##    - These may be .h or .c files.
    ##

    ## Preprocessor Header File Listing Handling
    ## =========================================
    ##
    ## Creation:
    ##  - This output is created with the -MM -MG -H command line options.
    ##    - -MM -MG generates unused make rule that significantly reduces overall output.
    ##    - -H creates the header file output listing we actually want.
    ##  - Search paths are provided towards fully preprocessing all macros / conditionals and
    ##    symbols. (This produces a rich list of #includes far greater than we need.)
    ##
    ## Format (ignoring throwaway make rule):
    ##  - Each included filepath is listed per line.
    ##  - The depth of the #include nesting is signified by precending '.'s.
    ##  - Files directly #include'd in the file being preprocessed are at depth 1 ('.')
    ##
    ## Notes:
    ##  - Because search paths and defines are provided, error-free executiion is assumed.
    ##    If the preprocessor fails, issues exist that will cause full compilation to fail.
    ##  - Unfortuantely, because of ordering and nesting effects, a file directly #include'd may
    ##    not be listed at depth 1 ('.'). Instead, it may end up listed at greater depth beneath 
    ##    another #include'd file if both files reference it. That is, there is no way
    ##    to give the preprocessor full context and ask for only the files directly 
    ##    #include'd in the file being processed.
    ##  - The preprocessor outputs the -H #include listing to STDERR. We must redirect to
    ##    STDOOUT in order to access the full output.
    ##  - Since we're using search paths, all #included files will include paths. Depending on
    ##    circumstances, this could yield a list with generated mocks with full build paths.
    ##
    ## Approach:
    ##  - Match on each listing line a filepath preceeded by its depth
    ##  - One mode of using this preprocessor approach is as a fallback / double-check method 
    ##    if the simpler, earler shallow preprocessing produces no #include results. When used
    ##    this way we match only #include'd files at depth 1 ('.'), hoping we extract an
    ##    appropriate, usable list of #includes.
    ##

    #  4. Iterate remaining nested hash list and extract to common[] and filepath whose base

    # Iterate each _nested entry and extract filepaths with matching filepath in _shallow list
    _nested.each_key do |filepath|
      if _shallow.has_key?( filepath )
        common << filepath         # Copy to common
        _shallow.delete(filepath)  # Remove matching filepath from _shallow list
      end
    end

    # For each mached filepath, remove it from _nested list
    common.each { |item| _nested.delete(item) }

    # Find any reamining filepaths whose baseneame matches an entry in _shallow
    _nested.each_key do |filepath|
      common << filepath if _shallow.has_key?( File.basename(filepath) )
