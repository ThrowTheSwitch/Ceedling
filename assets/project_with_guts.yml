# Configuration for errors behaviors
#   - :not_found: is associated to the behavior when a folder is not found.
#     This configuration shall have the same indices from :paths: and is configured as follow:

#       - WARNING: Warning is logged but build continues
#       - HIDDEN: Nothing is logged
#   note: Default value for categories not specified, is "ERROR"
